<h2>Travel plans</h2>

<p>Travel dates are May 14th-May 21st,</p>

<p>To travel to Italy, we can take a plane to London (~$1.4k) and then take a train to Italy (~$135). This is much cheaper than a direct flight to Rome, which is about 3k.</p>

<p>We will have to take a train back to London to catch our return flight, so this is another $135 or so.</p>

<p>As far as hotel information goes, an example hotel we could stay at is <a href="https://www.napoleon.it/">this</a> for Rome and <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/Naples%2C%20FL/entity/ChcI353D37_a0pV4GgsvZy8xdzh3YnYxcxAB?q=hotels%20in%20naples&g2lb=2502548%2C2503771%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4284970%2C4291517%2C4306835%2C4429192%2C4515404%2C4597339%2C4718358%2C4723331%2C4731329%2C4757164%2C4778035%2C4814050%2C4821091%2C4861688%2C4864715%2C4865467%2C4874190%2C4874725%2C4886082%2C4886480%2C4893075%2C4902277%2C4905351%2C4906050%2C4920622%2C4926165%2C4926489%2C4928499%2C4931266%2C4931360%2C4931986%2C4934307%2C4935108%2C4936393%2C47061553&hl=en-US&gl=us&ssta=1&ts=CAESCgoCCAMKAggDEAAaIAoCGgASGhIUCgcI5w8QBRgSEgcI5w8QBRgVGAMyAggBKgkKBToDVVNEGgA&rp=OAFAAEgCogEKTmFwbGVzLCBGTJoCAggA&ap=aAE&ictx=1&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwiosY7IquH8AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAw&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link&utm_source=htls">this</a> for Naples.</p>
<p>In total, hotels should cost no more than 1.5k (this is a generous upper bound estimate).</p>

<h2>Travel Activities</h2>
<p>I would like to visit Rome and Naples.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of things we could do:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Walk around tour</li>
    <li>Wine tour</li>
    <li>Art museums</li>
    <li>History museums (especially in Rome)</li>
    <li>Collosseum in Rome</li>
    <li>Restaurants</li>
    <li>Center of Naples, a UNESCO World Heritage site with a bunch of cool stuff</li>
    <li>Archeology museum in Naples</li>
    <li>Take a ferry to the island of Capri, which is known for its beautiful beaches, crystal-clear waters, and stunning views of the Gulf of Naples</li>
</ul>

<h2>Estimated Cost</h2>

<p>This is a rough upper bound.</p>
<p>London Plane = 1.4k*2=$2.8k</p>
<p>Italy Train = 135*4 = $540</p>
<p>Hotels = 1.5k</p>
<p>Per Diem = 1k</p>
<p>Total = Hotels + London Plane + Italy Train + Per Diem = $5840</p>

<p>Happy to help cover some of this.</p>
